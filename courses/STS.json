Students act as informal consultants to the MIT Museum, offering proposals for innovative elements that will be seriously considered for inclusion in the new Museum."}, "Histories of Information, Communication, and Computing Technologies": {"title": "Histories of Information, Communication, and Computing Technologies", "number": "STS.460", "description": "Introduction to the historical study of information, communication, and computing technologies with a focus on the United States. Pairs analysis of a multidisciplinary reading list with in-depth discussions of research methods and writing for academic publications. Later weeks of the course adapt to student interests and are determined by students in consultation with the instructor. Limited to 15."}, "Social and Political Implications of Technology": {"title": "Social and Political Implications of Technology", "number": "STS.462", "description": "Historical and contemporary studies are used to explore the interaction of technology with social and political values.  Emphasis on how technological devices, structures, and systems influence the organization of society and the behavior of its members.  Examples drawn from the technologies of war, transportation, communication, production, and reproduction."}, "Technocracy": {"title": "Technocracy", "number": "STS.463[J]", "description": "Survey of the history of efforts to apply scientific methods and technological tools to solve social and political problems, with a focus on the United States since 1850. Topics include: city planning, natural resource management, public education, economic development, quantification and modeling in the social and policy sciences, technology transfer, and political economies of expertise."}, "The History of Aviation": {"title": "The History of Aviation", "number": "STS.467[J]", "description": "Reading course in the history of aviation, focusing on science and technology and cultural and political context. Themes include: the science of aeronautics, pilots and piloting, control systems and electronics, engineering epistemology, infrastructure, industry, government and politics, evolution of aeronautics research, culture and experience, automation and autonomy, role of MIT, literature and film.  Case studies of specific systems and engineering projects. Emphasis is on book-length texts, close reading, historical methods of analyzing technological change. Study of social and political dimensions of engineering projects, examination of aviation institutions. Students prepare weekly response papers to readings, make extended presentations to class twice per semester, and submit a final research paper."}, "Research Seminar: Human, Remote and Autonomous Systems in Air, Sea, and Space": {"title": "Research Seminar: Human, Remote and Autonomous Systems in Air, Sea, and Space", "number": "STS.470[J]", "description": "Examines relationships between human-occupied, remotely operated, and autonomous systems in the extreme environments of the deep ocean, air, and spaceflight. Uses a mix of historical, sociological, and engineering perspectives, examines different forms of human presence in each type of system and how they relate to each other in time and space, including: physical hand-on-the stick flying, supervisory control, remote operation, systems design, programming autonomous systems, management. Emphasis on networks of people interacting in networks of organizations through networks of machines."}, "Engineering Apollo: The Moon Project as a Complex System": {"title": "Engineering Apollo: The Moon Project as a Complex System", "number": "STS.471[J]", "description": "Detailed technical and historical exploration of the Apollo project to fly humans to the moon and return them safely to Earth as an example of a complex engineering system. Emphasizes how the systems worked, the technical and social processes that produced them, mission operations, and historical significance. Guest lectures by MIT-affiliated engineers who contributed to and participated in the Apollo missions. Students work in teams on a final project analyzing an aspect of the historical project to articulate and synthesize ideas in engineering systems."}, "Writing: Science, Technology, and Society": {"title": "Writing: Science, Technology, and Society", "number": "STS.477[J]", "description": "Examination of different \"voices\" used to consider issues of scientific, technological, and social concern. Students write frequently and choose among a variety of non-fiction forms: historical writing, social analysis, political criticism, and policy reports. Instruction in expressing ideas clearly and in organizing a thesis-length work. Reading and writing on three case studies drawn from the history of science; the cultural study of technology and science; and policy issues."}}
