Building on the skills and relationships acquired in the Engineering Practice Workshop, students receive coaching to articulate goals, invoke the UPOP network of mentors and employers, identify and pursue opportunities and negotiate terms of their summer assignment. Students complete a 10-12 week internship, which includes filing three progress reports, conducting one informational interview, and possibly hosting a site visit by MIT staff. Returning to campus as juniors, UPOP students take part in reflective exercises that aid assimilation of learning objectives and reinforce the cognitive link between all aspects of the UPOP experience and disciplinary fields of study. Sequence begins in the spring of sophomore year and ends in the fall of junior year."}, "UPOP Engineering Practice Workshop": {"title": "UPOP Engineering Practice Workshop", "number": "1.EPW", "description": "Develops foundational skills for the world of practice in science, technology, and engineering. Sophomores receive classroom instruction, and one-on-one and small-group coaching in basics of professional identity building. They attend field trips to local employers and receive job interview practice, coached by industry volunteers. Over IAP, students attend a weeklong Team Training Camp of experiential learning modules - led by MIT faculty with the help of MIT alums and other senior professionals in business, engineering, and science where students participate in creative simulations, team problem-solving challenges, and oral presentations, and practice networking with employers.
